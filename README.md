In VenueMenu workspace, 
VenueMain/src/venue/VenueData.java is class used to calcualte haversine function, extracting all the output from the database,
displaying of all the outputs and main menu selection from user.

VenueMain/src/venue/VenueMain.java is the main class consist of all code for connecting to database, switch case for doing

Informal Summary Report 

Abstract:

This document is a summary of ideas used and challenges faced while completing the given task. It gives a very brief overview 
of software used and the approach to solve some of the interesting challenges encountered during the task 

Software:

Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, Java SE 8u45, MongoDB 3.0.3 were used to complete the task.

Database: NOSql should have been no problem (pun intended!!)

Having had no prior experience with NOSql I looked online for the various solutions. I learnt mainly there are four variants 
for NOSql database. Among those column based looked familiar to MySQL that I had worked as well as a good alternative for my 
current task. It took me whole two days of trying to install and after crashing my computer to realize that Cassandra and 
Hbase arenâ€™t working as well as expected. 

MongoDB: Third time is the charm!

I decided to install it. Installation was much simpler and involved just a double click and changing a single config file.
Running the database and importing the CSV involved just a one-line command and no need to create a schema unlike Cassandra.

Haversine Formula

I have used uber and yelp many times but till date never gave a thought how did they display data in the app given my position. Thanks to Haversine Formula I was able to 
solve a the challenge to find the distance given the longitude and latitude  

Query Parser 

MongoDB query outputs the data in BSON format. I used JSON parser to extract key value pair from the output

Added Feature:

User supplied input (not all) are validated against a regex for input validation. Currently for zipcode,city and venue name.
